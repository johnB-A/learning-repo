# learning-repo
This repo's main focus is to learn about different types of topics. My priority will be digital design, specially focusing on VHDL and possibly hardware(FPGA). 
Second focus will be in embedded systems, specifially becoming comfortable with the basics, such as embedded C and learning how to use the hadware.
Third focus will be anything that catches my interest at the time.
